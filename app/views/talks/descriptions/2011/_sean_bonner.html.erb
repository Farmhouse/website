  Sean will be talking about Safecast (previously known as RDTN), a group he co-founded in March after the 3/11 earthquake in Japan and resulting problems at the Fukushima nuclear reactor showed a vast lack of radiation data available to the public that wasn&rsquo;t coming from a corporation or activist group.
  Safecast aims to create a global open data network of sensors and is currently focused on Japan.
  Sean has just returned from Tokyo and will be talking about their efforts there.
