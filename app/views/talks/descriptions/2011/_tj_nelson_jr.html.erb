  Tj is the best photographer and videographer that Shane knows.
  Aside from speaking at the conference, he&rsquo;ll also be photographing it.
  Tj used to work for Apple Stores at the Creative Bar giving lessons on the various Apple iLife apps.
  One time whilst on the Cupertino Apple campus, he gave the worst product demo of his life to Steve Jobs&rsquo; wife and others.
  That experience changed him forever and he&rsquo;ll tell you how.
