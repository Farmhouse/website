<p>Marc will discuss three of his projects that deal with the idea of mapping via travel, both physical and virtual. 1) <i>The National Dinner Tour</i>, a project where Marc wrote &ldquo;dinner w/ marc 510-872-7326,&rdquo; his name and cell phone, on a dry erase board featured in a Crate &amp; Barrel catalog. He eventually received over 30,000 calls from people wanting to dine with him. As a result, He traveled the US in a tiny RV for a year dining with strangers. 2) <i>The Signature Series</i>, where Marc signed his name on a US map and then drove that route, &ldquo;improving&rdquo; towns along the way. For example, he started the first ever Semi-anonymous Nudist Colony in Nampa, Idaho and buried an entire town's problems in Craig, Colorado. And 3) <i>Google Maps Road Trip</i>, where Marc and his friend Pete Baldes virtually traveled across the US entirely on Google Maps using the arrow keys to drive.</p>
