      <h2>Speaker Sponsorship : $350</h2>

      <p class="notes">
        This year nearly every past speaker is returning to give short Alumni Updates.
        It's a great way to continue the thread of past confs/talks/speakers.
        And a perfect way to wrap this whole thing up.

        A lot of them are traveling on an airplane from another city.
        Which means we need some sponsors to help us cover their travel costs.

        Each party sponsorship is $350
        for Farmhouse Conf 5 (November 2, 2013).
