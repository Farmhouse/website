          <strong>Description:</strong>
          What is the usefulness of fiction &mdash; utopian fiction in particular &mdash; in anarchist struggle and social change? Starting with a historical overview of anarchist fiction writers, this talk will discuss how fiction impacts social struggle, and the interrelation of storytelling and social change. We will then explore the nuances of writing a dystopia versus a utopia? Is writing a dystopian novel the easy way out? What are are the unique challenges of writing a utopia?

          <strong>Bio:</strong>
          Author and editor <a href="https://twitter.com/magpiekilljoy">Margaret Killjoy</a> is touring to promote his forthcoming book, <a href="http://www.combustionbooks.org/products-page/fiction/a-country-of-ghosts/" title="A Country of Ghosts">A Country of Ghosts</a>, an anarchist utopian novel to be published by Combustion Books. In this talk, Margaret will focus on the usefulness of fiction &mdash; with a focus on utopian fiction &mdash; in anarchist struggle. Check out the awesome video below of Margaret speaking with Ursula K LeGuin in Portland.
        </p>

        <p>
          Margaret Killjoy is the editor of Mythmakers &amp; Lawbreakers: Anarchist Writers on Fiction as well as We Are Many: Reflections on Movement Strategy from Occupation to Liberation (which was referred to as &ldquo;deftly edited&rdquo; by The New Yorker). His first fiction book was What Lies Beneath the Clock Tower. Margaretâ€™s fiction has been praised by Alan Moore and Cory Doctorow, and SJ Chambers called the book, &ldquo;A fun read, not only engaging, but also enlightening. It is a story about class warfare, capitalism, oppression, revolution, and most of all free will.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
          Margaret will be touring the southern part of the US throughout most of March 2014, making stops in Maryland, Virginia, Nortch Carolina, Georgia, Flordia, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, and California.

          <blockquote>&ldquo;Over the years, Margaret Killjoy has spoken in our community bookstore on a wide range of topics &mdash; literary, artistic and political. Killjoy&lsquo;s presentations are always marked with a unique flourish for showmanship and never fail to find an audience eager to be challenged and entertained.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          &mdash; Libertie Valance, Worker/Owner at Firestorm Cafe &amp; Book
        </p>

        <p>
          <blockquote>&ldquo;This gritty evocative novel explores the question of what an anarchist community can do to resist the assaults that are sure to come if any such social formation were to exist.  That&lsquo;s all extremely interesting and yet more important still is that this is an exciting and mysterious novel, a story of war and love in some fictional mountainous country with echoes of nineteenth century Latin America, eastern Europe, central Asia; by the time you&lsquo;re done you feel you&lsquo;ve gotten a glimpse into a forgotten part of our history that is nevertheless very real.&rdquo;</blockquote>
          &mdash; Kim Stanley Robinson
        </p>

        <p>
          <blockquote>&ldquo;This is a fierce, intelligent, hopeful book - a fantasy (of sorts) of unusual seriousness, humanity and wit.&rdquo;</blockquote>
